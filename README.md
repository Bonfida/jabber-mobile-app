- Android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bonfida.jabber](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bonfida.jabber)

## Local environment

The app is built with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)

To install the Expo:

```
yarn global add expo-cli
```

To launch the local environment

```
yarn && yarn start
```

## Smart contract

The smart contract can be found here: [Jabber smart contract](https://github.com/Bonfida/jabber)

## Secret key üö®

The secret key is stored using `expo-secure-store` [https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/)

## Transactions

On the mobile versions, transactions don't need to be approved, **they are automatically approved**.

## Encryption

- DMs: For DMs (i.e 1 on 1 conversations) all messages are encrypted end to end using [Diffie-Hellman keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman). The encryption happens on the mobile before sending the message on-chain. For images, videos and audios, the file is encrypted using Diffie-Hellman, uploaded on IPFS, then the IPFS hash is encrypted and sent on-chain.

- Groups: Groups are **unencrypted** at the moment. This means that the entire group chat history is visible on-chain. If you want to contribute to the repo to add group encryption using [Double Ratchet](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/) please reach out to us, grants are available.

## Cost

Gas cost will depend on the length of your message

| Message length (characters) | Transaction fee (SOL) |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 100                         | ~0.002                |
| 200                         | ~0.0026               |
| 500                         | ~0.00469              |
| 1,000                       | ~0.0082               |
| 2,000                       | ~0.015                |

For files, the gas cost does not depend on the size of the file because only the IPFS hash is sent on-chain.
